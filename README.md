I made the 3D scan using an app called Trnio. Used Blender to turn it into a 3D model. Exported as a .glb file to Reality Viewer. That converts it to a .usdz file that Safari can read. Then i dropped the model into the site, in the same way you would insert an image file. Safari does all the rest, using an inbuilt tool called QuickLook and some hardware in your iPhone called ARKit.
